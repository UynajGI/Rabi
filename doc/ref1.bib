  abstract = {Schrieffer-Wolff transformation is extensively used in quantum manybody physics to calculate the low energy effective Hamiltonian. It offers a perturbative method to understand the renormalization effects in the strong coupling regime of the quantum many-body models. The generator for Schrieffer-Wolff transformation is calculated using heuristic methods. It is highly desirable to have a rigorous, systematic and simple method for the calculation of this highly important transformation. In this paper, we put forward such method. We demontrate our method by applying it to few well-known models from various fields like strongly correlated electron systems, quantum optics and cavity electrodynamics. Our method can be applied to a broad class of quantum many-body Hamiltonians.},

  abstract = {We introduce an eigen microstate approach (EMA) in the quantum system to describe the quantum phase transition without knowing the order parameter. Phases of a quantum system are determined by the so-called eigen microstates and their corresponding eigenvalues, which satisfy scaling relations in the critical regime. The quantum Rabi model (QRM) is taken as an example to demonstrate the validity of the EMA. Using both analytical and numerical calculations, we obtain the critical point, critical exponents, and scaling functions of the superradiant phase transition in the QRM. It suggests that a new phase emergency can be interpreted as a condensation of a specific eigen microstate. We expect that, in further studies, the EMA will be applied to more complex quantum phase transition problems in which order parameters cannot be easily defined.},

  abstract = {Spin-orbit coupling makes the spin degree of freedom respond to its orbital environment. In solids this yields such intriguing phenomena as a spin splitting of electron states in inversion-asymmetric systems even at zero magnetic field and a Zeeman splitting that is significantly enhanced in magnitude over that for free electrons. This book describes spin-orbit coupling effects in quasi-two-dimensional electron and hole systems. The first part provides a general introduction to the electronic structure of quasi-two-dimensional systems with a particular focus on group-theoretical methods. The main part of the monograph is devoted to spin-orbit coupling phenomena at zero and nonzero magnetic fields. Throughout the book, the main focus is on a thorough discussion of the physical ideas and a detailed interpretation of the results. Accurate numerical calculations are complemented by simple and transparent analytical models that capture the important physics},
